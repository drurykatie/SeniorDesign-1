				Phishing emails and text messages will always look like they are from a company, bank, person, social media site 
				or something else you know or trust. 
			</li>

				Phishing emails and text messages will always sound <b>Too Good To Be True!</b>. 
				They will often attempt to tell you a convincing story about how they have noticed suspicious activities on your account, 
				make you a lucrative offers, or simply have eye-catching or attention-grabbing statements.
				Remember that if it seems to good to be true, it probably is!

				Phishing emails and text messages are designed to attract your attention immediately and create a sense of Urgency. 
				They will often ask you to act fast because the "super deal" will only be valid for a limited time, 
				tell you that your account will be suspended unless you update your personal details immediately,
				or anything else that will require you to take immediate action.
				Some of them will even tell you that you have only a few minutes to respond. 
				It's best practice to simply ignore these kinds of emails or text messages when you come across them.
			</li>

			<li>
				Phishing emails and text messages will often attempt to trick you into clicking on a malicious link or opening an attachment.
				Remember that hovering over a link will show you the actual URL where you will be directed upon clicking on it, so look carefully.
				Furthermore, if you see an attachment in an email you were not expecting, DO NOT OPEN IT.
				They often contain payloads like ransomware or other viruses.
